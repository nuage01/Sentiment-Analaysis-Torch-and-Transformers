However, if you drink one cup a day, then this is the better option as it is of slightly better quality. Cheers my fellow coffee addicts.

"This is a great coffeebean blend from Cape Town and is my personal choice to be the daily driving force in my cup.

Positive things to note:
-This is a medium roast, which I prefer because one can actually taste the subtleties, when compared to dark roasts which have basically no distinction.
-The manufacturing date (hopefully comparable to the roasting date) was within the same month of my order, so that is great! Not many roasters manage that. That is why I prefer online.

The capsules are not 100% compatible with the nespresso machine.  The coffee delivery is very slow and takes forever to fill the cup - I doubt if it is good for the machine as it just dribbles out the spout.  It helps if you puncture holes in the back of the pod but I am not going to use these pods.,UK,10/12/2020,26 October 2018,1,takealot,Nespresso Compatible Coffee 100 Capsules - Bulk Special (No Decaffe),PLID41141718,3.9/5,150,1.0/5

Not very impressed with these capsules. They are weak in taste and they don't work properly in a Nespresso machine. The back of the capsules are too hard for the machine to puncture.

"You get what you pay for. 

These capsules aren't bad but they're not good either. The coffee is a bit weak and it tastes about the same as coffee quickly thrown together in a plunger. 

Please note that the capsules are not 100% the same as nespresso capsules. They are a bit smaller at the back meaning your machine cannot punch the 3 holes. Instead the capsule has tiny ""cuts"" at the back, and your machine must work harder to force water through these capsules. My Delonghi machine sounded different when using these capsules.

Used them twice and they fulfill  their purpose. 
Theyâ€™re easy to use in theory, however execution has proven to be a bit messy with coffee everywhere.

Not sure if the coffee I used was the wrong coarseness or strength for the pods, but they did render a slightly weaker brew.

"Well what can I say. For me, these are great seeing that they are reusable but it just puts back a lot of effort in making coffee. I need to firstly grind my coffee beans then find a way to carefully fill it up into this capsule with a possibility of spilling. I found that u can not really control the strength of the coffee no matter how much u try compacting the ground coffee into the capsule.

in my opinion nothing beats the taste of Coca cola.

"I have two complaints; (1) all of the 12 cans I have opened (from the pack of 24)so far have been virtually without fizz and (2) I have not previously had Pink Tonic with cucumber and this should be made clear on the description; it was an unexpected and unpleasant addition to the taste. If this had occurred outside the lock-down I would have sent it back. The taste, lack of fizz and overall disappointment in drinking pleasure leads me to say I will NOT buy a Fitch & Leeds product again, nor will I order this type of product from Takealot again.

Well-judged medium roast that's never acid or bitter. Enjoyable drinking all day long from our Saeco automatic machine.

"I ordered 3x 1kg bags, wanted 4x, but takealot only had 3 in stock and I didn't want to wait another 4 weeks for my coffee beans.

I would not say I have a expert pallet when it comes to coffee tasting, but I do like my espresso & cafÃ© (basically just a triple sized espresso). I also do taste the differences in different coffee beans, blends and roasts.
I'm always shopping for some good blends and roasts that will not cost an arm or a leg. Because coffee beans has become ridiculously expensive. (Another funny thing is that means are more expensive than the grind - would love to know why? Seeing there is more work that goes into grind and the extra cost of the grinding equipment.)

Ok, to my order. I do not know if the 3x 1kg bags I got was lying at Takealot's warehouse for the past 3 years or it the beans, blend or roast, but it has almost no taste. The bean when you taste it strait up is very hard and dry. None of the above flavours can be tasted. And you only get a hint of coffee taste. 
This is definitely not the full bodied espresso flavour one would expect and definitely without any aromatic flavours.

Sorry Tribe, but this batch do not get my vote.  ",UK,10/12/2020,17 November 2014,1,takealot,Tribe Coffee - 1kg Beans,PLID29890795,4.0/5,54,1.0/5
